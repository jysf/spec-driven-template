# Maps to ContextCore handoff.* semantic conventions.
#
# ONE handoff per delegated CYCLE. With build and verify running on different
# agents you get TWO handoffs per spec (HANDOFF-N build, HANDOFF-M verify) —
# `handoff.cycle` is what distinguishes them.
#
# The `handback:` block below is the RETURN path and it is not optional: it is
# how cost gets into the spec without the orchestrator hand-counting anything.
# `just handback-sync SPEC-NNN` reads it and appends the cost session for you.
# Rationale + the full contract: docs/decisions/DEC-013-delegated-cost-handback.md

# part of completing the handoff, not a courtesy.

# `tokens_total` is the one field the cost gate reads. Report the REAL number
# from your own interface:
#   Claude Code   → run `/cost`
#   API           → the `usage` object (input + output, summed)
#   another agent → whatever your harness reports as total tokens
# If your platform genuinely exposes NO token count, set tokens_total: null AND
# write why in `notes` — then set `cost.metering_source: none` in
# .repo-context.yaml so the gate stops asking. Do not invent a number.

# HANDOFF-XXX: <Task Title — same as the spec's title>

## Delegation Summary

One sentence: `<from_agent>` (acting as `<from_role>`) hands `SPEC-XXX`
to `<to_agent>` (acting as `<to_role>`) for the **`<cycle>`** cycle.

## Context the Receiving Agent Needs

The receiving agent MUST read these before starting work. Keep the
list tight, but don't omit anything necessary.

### Primary

- **Project brief:** `./projects/PROJ-XXX-<slug>/brief.md`
- **Stage:** `./projects/PROJ-XXX-<slug>/stages/STAGE-XXX-<slug>.md`
- **Spec:** `./projects/PROJ-XXX-<slug>/specs/SPEC-XXX-<slug>.md`
- **Reviewer brief (OPTIONAL, verify handoffs):** `./guidance/agents/<lens>.md` —
  pick a lens if this review should look at one thing hard. Omit for a
  general review; see `./guidance/agents/README.md`.
- **Toolchain brief:** `./guidance/toolchain-brief.md` — this repo's test
  framework, lint quirks, runtime globals and gotchas. Read it; it exists so a
  cold agent doesn't rediscover them (DEC-004 rule 5).

### Decisions that apply

- `DEC-NNN` — <one-line summary of why this matters here>
- `DEC-MMM` — <one-line summary>

### Constraints that apply

Check `./guidance/constraints.yaml` for full text. These constraints
apply to the paths touched by this task:

- `constraint-id-1` — <one-line summary>
- `constraint-id-2` — <one-line summary>

### Prior related work

- `HANDOFF-YYY` — <one-line summary, if relevant>
- `PR #NNN` — <link, if relevant>

## Expected Deliverables

*(For a `verify` handoff, replace this block with the verify contract below.)*

- Code changes implementing SPEC-XXX's Acceptance Criteria.
- All failing tests in SPEC-XXX now passing.
- Any new tests required to cover edge cases.
- A PR against `main` from branch `feat/spec-XXX-<slug>`.
- PR description referencing: this handoff ID, the spec ID, the stage
  ID, the project ID, all referenced `DEC-*`, and any new `DEC-*`
  created during implementation.

### If `cycle: verify` — the verify contract

You are **not** the agent that implemented this. Review it cold.

- Acceptance criteria met? Tests actually pass? Build reflection answered
  honestly (*"nothing was unclear"* is suspicious)?
- Decision drift — run `just decisions-audit --changed`.
- Constraint violations; non-trivial choices missing a `DEC-*`.
- For any criterion claiming **runtime behavior** (a component registers, a hook
  fires, a binary resolves on PATH, a config takes effect), confirm the
  *behavioral* surface was exercised — not just the shape validated. That is the
  defect class that escapes (AGENTS.md §12).
- Output exactly ONE of: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED.

## Out of Scope

Explicit list of what this handoff does NOT include. If the receiving agent
thinks any of these need to happen, they should create a new spec in
the stage's backlog, not expand this handoff.

- ...

## Return Criteria — how to hand back

**Completing this handoff means filling in the `handback:` front-matter block
above AND the `## Handback` section below.** An unfilled handback is an
incomplete cycle, and `just handback-sync` will tell the orchestrator so.

On success:
1. Fill the `handback:` front-matter — **including a real `tokens_total`**.
2. Fill the `## Handback` section (the reflection is part of it, not optional).
3. Set `handoff.status` → `completed` and `handback.status` → `completed`.
4. Open a PR (build) or return your verdict (verify).

If you cannot complete the task:
1. Fill the `## Handback` section with what was done and what blocked you.
2. Set `handoff.status` → `rejected`, `handback.status` → `blocked`.
3. **Still report your token usage** — blocked work costs money too.
4. Set the spec's `task.blocked: true` and add a question to
   `/guidance/questions.yaml`.

## Handback

*Filled in by the receiving agent. The orchestrator does not reconstruct any of
this — it transcribes it. The reflection questions are part of completion.*

### Execution notes

- **Branch / PR:** [link]
- **Completed at:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **All acceptance criteria met?** yes/no (if no, explain)
- **For `verify`:** the verdict — ✅ APPROVED (at commit SHA) / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED

### Cost self-report

Mirror what you put in the `handback:` front-matter, and say where the number
came from. **This is the number that lands in the spec** — the orchestrator
transcribes it via `just handback-sync`, it does not estimate it.

- **Tokens (total):** <real number, or null + why>
- **Estimated USD:** <number, or null>
- **Duration (minutes):** <estimate>
- **Source of the number:** `/cost` | API `usage` | harness report | none available

### Drift and new artifacts

- **New decisions emitted:**
  - `DEC-NNN` — <title> (if any)
- **Deviations from spec:**
  - [list]
- **Follow-up work identified:**
  - [any new specs that should be added to the stage's backlog]

### Reflection (3 questions, short answers)

1. **What was unclear in the spec or handoff that slowed you down?**
   — <answer>

2. **Was there a constraint or decision that should have been listed but wasn't?**
   — <answer>

3. **If you did this task again, what would you do differently?**
   — <answer>
