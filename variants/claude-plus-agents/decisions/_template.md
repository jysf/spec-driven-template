# DEC-XXX: <Short Title — what was decided>

## Decision

One sentence stating what was chosen. The most important line in
the file. Make it precise.

## Context

What problem were we solving? What constraints applied? What
triggered this decision (a spec, a bug, a question)?

## Alternatives Considered

- **Option A: <name>**
  - What it is: ...
  - Why rejected: ...

- **Option B: <name>**
  - What it is: ...
  - Why rejected: ...

- **Option C (chosen): <name>**
  - What it is: ...
  - Why selected: ...

## Consequences

- **Positive:** What this unlocks or makes easier.
- **Negative:** What this costs or forecloses.
- **Neutral:** Side effects worth noting.

## Validation

How will we know this decision was right? What would cause us to
revisit it?
