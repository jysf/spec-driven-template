# AGENTS.md — Claude-Only Variant

Instructions for Claude working across all phases of this repository. Read this file first, every session.

> This variant assumes Claude plays every role: architect, implementer, reviewer. The context normally in a handoff document lives inside each spec's `## Implementation Context` section.

> This file contains conventions only. For rules/constraints, see `/guidance/constraints.yaml`. For architectural rationale, see `/decisions/`. For waves of work against this app, see `/projects/`.

## 1. Repo Overview

- **Repo (the app):** [REPLACE: My App]
- **Purpose:** [REPLACE: one sentence]
- **Primary stakeholders:** [REPLACE]
- **Active project:** [REPLACE: PROJ-001 — MVP]

See `.repo-context.yaml` for structured metadata.

---

## 2. Work Hierarchy

```
REPO (the app — persists across all projects)
 └─ PROJECT (a wave of work: "MVP", "improvements", "v2 redesign")
     └─ STAGE (a coherent chunk within a project)
         └─ SPEC (an individual task)
```

- The **repo** is the app. `AGENTS.md`, `/docs/`, `/guidance/`,
  `/decisions/` live at repo level because they accumulate across all
  projects.
- A **project** (`/projects/PROJ-*/`) is a bounded wave of work.
- A **stage** is an epic-sized chunk within a project (2–5 per project).
- A **spec** is a single implementable task. Belongs to one stage in
  one project.

In this variant, Claude plays architect and implementer in **separate
sessions**. The spec file itself carries all the context — see its
`## Implementation Context` section.

**Decisions persist at repo level.** A decision made during PROJ-001
binds PROJ-002 as well.

**Specs do not cross project boundaries.**

**IDs are globally unique and continuous across the repo.** `STAGE-*` and
`SPEC-*` numbers keep counting up across projects — they do **not** restart at
001 per project. If PROJ-001 ends at `STAGE-006` / `SPEC-037`, PROJ-002 begins
at `STAGE-007` / `SPEC-038`. `just new-stage` / `just new-spec` assign the next
number repo-wide, so an ID unambiguously identifies one artifact anywhere.

---

## 3. Business Value

Value structure exists at project and stage levels; specs link lightly.

**Project `value:` block** states the thesis — a testable claim about
what this wave of work delivers. Beneficiaries, success signals, and
risks to the thesis make it falsifiable, not marketing copy.

**Stage `value_contribution:` block** states what this coherent chunk
of work advances, what capabilities it delivers, and what it
explicitly doesn't try to do. Helps avoid stages that seem valuable
but don't contribute to the project thesis.

**Spec `value_link:`** is a one-sentence reference back to the
stage's value. Infrastructure specs may have
`value_link: "infrastructure enabling X"`. Optional but encouraged —
it surfaces specs that don't trace back to the thesis.

Reports (`just report-daily`, `just report-weekly`) aggregate these
signals: which stages advanced the thesis, which specs most directly
delivered it, and where value traceability broke down.

---

## 4. Cost Tracking Discipline

Every cycle on a spec appends a session entry to the spec's
`cost.sessions` list, with a **real** `tokens_total` for metered cycles —
so reports aggregate actual AI spend, not zeros. Documentation alone is
skippable, and cost tracking silently goes empty (all-null numerics) the
moment a prompt says "leave it null"; the rule below + `just cost-audit`
make it stick. Full reference: `docs/cost-tracking.md`.

- **Schema:** a single combined `tokens_total` per session (the harness
  reports one number — `subagent_tokens` in an `Agent` result, or `/cost`
  interactively). Do NOT split input/output; there is no reliable split.
- **build / verify cycles** run as metered subagents: the ORCHESTRATOR
  reads `subagent_tokens` + `duration_ms` from the `Agent` result and
  writes the real `tokens_total` / `duration_minutes` / `estimated_usd`
  into the spec at **ship**. (If run interactively, use `/cost`.) These
  cycles must NOT be left null.
- **design / ship cycles** are orchestrator main-loop work with no clean
  per-cycle metering — leave numerics `null` with a "main-loop, not
  separately metered" note.
- **`estimated_usd`** = `tokens_total` × your model's published list rate,
  no cache discount — an order-of-magnitude estimate; say so in the note.
- **Other interfaces:** `interface: claude-ai` (estimate by length),
  `api` (the `usage` object), `ollama`/`other`. Only genuinely un-metered
  cycles may be null-with-note.

The cycle-prompt wording lives in
`projects/_templates/prompts/cost-snippet.md` — use it so prompts don't
re-introduce the "null numerics" loophole. **Ship computes `cost.totals`**
(sum of non-null sessions; `tokens_total` uses `0`, never `null`) and runs
`just cost-audit`, which **fails if any shipped spec lacks build/verify
cost** (constraint `cost-captured-per-cycle`; CI job `cost-data`; surfaced
in `just status` and `report-weekly`). Pre-process specs can be
grandfathered via `COST_AUDIT_GRANDFATHERED` in `scripts/_lib.sh` (empty
by default).

Reports aggregate cost by cycle, by interface, by spec, and by stage.

## 6. Commands (exact)

These are the APP's commands. Wire them into **`app.just`** so they run as
`just build`, `just dev`, `just test`, etc. `app.just` is project-owned and
imported by the template-managed root `justfile` — keep app recipes there (not
in `justfile`) so a template update never clobbers your commands. For
template/workflow commands (`status`, `new-spec`, …) see `justfile`.

```bash
[REPLACE: install command]
[REPLACE: dev command]
[REPLACE: test command]
[REPLACE: test single file command]
[REPLACE: lint command]
[REPLACE: typecheck command]
[REPLACE: build command]

## 8. Cycle Model

Every spec moves through five cycles. **Cycles are tags, not gates**.

| Cycle | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **frame** | Go/no-go on the spec |
| **design** | Write the spec + failing tests + implementation context |
| **build** | Make failing tests pass |
| **verify** | Review + validation in one pass |
| **ship** | Merge, deploy, reflect, archive |

Valid transitions:
```
frame → design → build → verify → ship
                   ↑       │
                   └───────┘ (verify sends back on punch list)
```

**`frame` is optional — most specs start at `design`.** By the time a task
reaches `just new-spec` it has usually already passed go/no-go at the
stage/backlog level, so `frame` is redundant (across the dogfood it went unused —
0 of 100+ specs). Use it only when a spec's very existence is genuinely in
question; otherwise begin at `design`.

**In this variant**, use **separate sessions** for each cycle (this variant
assumes one agent — Claude by default — playing every role in fresh sessions;
on another agent, read "session" as "fresh session/agent", see docs/porting.md).
A fresh session prevents design-phase context from contaminating build
decisions, and a fresh verify session catches drift a continuation
session wouldn't.

Project and stage lifecycles are lighter:
- **Project status:** `proposed | active | on_hold | shipped | cancelled` — the
  **coarse, machine-keyed** lifecycle state tooling branches on. Keep it coarse.
- **Project `activity`** (optional): a **human-facing** refinement of the work
  happening *within* an `active` project — `requirements | design | build | test |
  blocked` (a suggested **open** set; extend it, e.g. `spike`). It says *what kind
  of work is going on now* without abusing `status` or making the project look
  stalled. Example: a project gathering requirements before any spec is framed sets
  `status: active` + `activity: requirements`. `validate` warns on an unrecognized
  value but never fails; downstream readers may treat some activities as quiet
  phases (e.g. suppress "cut a release" nudges during `requirements`).
- **Stage status:** `proposed | active | shipped | cancelled | on_hold`

### The patch lane (lightweight fixes — DEC-003)

A **patch** is a bounded fix to *already-shipped* behavior (a bug or UX papercut)
that adds **no new feature/command** and doesn't warrant a full spec + stage. It
runs a collapsed **`patch → verify → ship`** cycle instead of a spec's five:

- **patch** — design + build fused into one test-first pass (write the failing
  test *and* the fix together).
- **verify** — **kept, and kept independent** (a separate session). This is the
  one discipline the dogfood retrospective proved catches real defects; it is
  non-negotiable.
- **ship** — CHANGELOG `[Unreleased] → Fixed` + `just archive-patch`. **No stage
  bookkeeping** — a patch attaches to the project, not a stage.

**Stays:** the full gate suite, a `DEC-*` when there's a real decision, and
index-verify-before-ship. **Sheds:** the separate frame + design cycles and the
stage backlog/`Count:` bookkeeping. **Guardrail:** if a change adds a
command/flag or needs its own design exploration, it's a **spec, not a patch**.

Mechanics: `just new-patch "title" [PROJ-NNN]` scaffolds
`projects/PROJ-*/patches/PATCH-NNN-<slug>.md` (its own repo-wide `PATCH-*`
sequence). Patches are first-class in `just validate`, `just cost-audit`
(metered on `patch`+`verify`), and `just status`. `just archive-patch PATCH-NNN`
files it under `patches/done/`.

---

## 9. Instruction Timeline

Every spec has a timeline file at
`projects/*/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md` listing cycle
instructions in order with status markers.

Status markers:

- `[ ]` not started — no one has picked this up yet
- `[~]` in progress — an executor is currently running this
- `[x]` complete — cycle finished; see the prompt file for what was run
- `[?]` blocked — needs a human decision or external unblock before
  proceeding. Include a one-line reason after the marker.

Cycle prompts live at `projects/*/specs/prompts/SPEC-NNN-<cycle>.md`.
The architect writes them; executors read and run them.

**Discipline for executors:**

- When you start a cycle, mark it `[~]`.
- When you finish, mark it `[x]` with a one-line result (PR number,
  cost, completion date).
- If you hit a real blocker — constraint ambiguous, dependency
  missing, verify surfaced something needing architect judgment —
  mark `[?]` with a one-line reason. Do NOT use `[?]` as a "I don't
  know what to do" dumping ground. Blocked means the next move
  requires someone else; everything else is in-progress or a
  question to resolve in the current session.

This is a convention, not a mechanism. No tooling enforces it; the
discipline lives in the prompt set. Skip it and nothing breaks, but
you lose the history artifact and the next executor has to hunt for
the right prompt.

---

## 10. Cross-Reference Rules

Every spec has these relationships, encoded in front-matter:
- `project.id` → the project it belongs to
- `project.stage` → the stage within that project
- `references.decisions` → DEC-* it was designed against
- `references.constraints` → constraints that apply

DECs are stable; specs come and go. DECs don't reciprocally list specs.

## 11. Coding Conventions

- **Naming:** [REPLACE]
- **File organization:** [REPLACE]
- **Imports:** [REPLACE]
- **Error handling:** [REPLACE]
- **Logging:** [REPLACE]
- **Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*.
- **No dead code.** Delete, don't comment out.
- **Diagrams:** author them as Mermaid fenced blocks in markdown
  (`/docs/`, `/decisions/`, specs) so they render on GitHub and you can
  keep them current as part of the work. Update the relevant diagram in
  the same change, not afterward. See `/guidance/recommended-tools.md`.

---

## 12. Testing Conventions

- Every new function gets at least one test.
- Test file naming: [REPLACE]
- Coverage expectations: [REPLACE]
- **TDD:** Tests live in the spec's `## Failing Tests` section, written
  during **design**, made to pass during **build**.
- **Behavioral pre-flight (design-time).** When a spec's literal/artifact makes a
  claim about *runtime behavior* — a component registers, a hook fires, a binary
  resolves on PATH, a server answers, a config is actually loaded — exercise that
  behavior through the surface that **runs** it before declaring design done, not
  merely the surface that **validates its shape**. A manifest that passes
  `validate --strict` can still register nothing; a completion script that lints
  can still emit the wrong marker; a config that parses can still not take effect.
  Shape-check and behavior-check are *different checks* — neither substitutes for
  the other. The defect class that escapes design→build→verify is disproportionately
  operational/runtime, not spec-logic; this is where to catch it.
- **Design-time probe / measure-before-build (design-time).** When a spec's
  implementation depends on the *actual* behavior of a load-bearing external — a
  library's real API signature, a tool resolving on the **pinned** toolchain, the
  true version floor, a config field the engine actually reads — or when it
  **tunes toward a measurable target**, probe or measure the real thing **against
  the real pinned tree during design**, and record the verified facts (the exact
  calls, the baseline number) in the spec's `## Implementation Context` (or the
  governing `DEC-*`). Two recurring moves: (1) **probe the real API/tool** — don't
  trust the model's prior; the pinned version's signature may differ (a wrong
  assumed call is then caught at design, not mid-build); (2) **measure the
  baseline now** so the target and the change are grounded in numbers, not
  guesses. When you do, build collapses to a near bit-for-bit *transcription*
  instead of a discovery loop — the strongest efficiency lesson from the dogfood
  (recurring across projects, highest single-lesson frequency). Complementary
  verify move — **adversarial mutation:** revert the change and confirm the guard
  *fails*; it both proves the test has teeth and surfaces dead/no-op config (a
  field the engine never reads).

## 13. Git and PR Conventions

- **Branch:** `feat/spec-NNN-<slug>`, etc.
- **One spec per branch, one PR per branch.**
- **Commits:** [REPLACE]
- **PR description must include:**
  - Project: `PROJ-NNN`
  - Stage: `STAGE-NNN`
  - Spec: `SPEC-NNN`
  - Decisions referenced, constraints checked, new `DEC-*` files

## 15. Cycle-Specific Rules

### During **build**

Start a **new session**. Do not continue from the design session.

Before writing code:
1. Read the spec's `## Implementation Context` section.
2. Read every `DEC-*` it references.
3. Read the parent `STAGE-*.md` and project `brief.md`.
4. Read `/guidance/constraints.yaml`.
5. Read `/guidance/toolchain-brief.md` — the per-repo toolchain facts (test
   framework, lint quirks, runtime globals, installed dev utilities, gotchas) a
   cold build agent otherwise re-derives loop by loop. **When delegating build
   to a sub-agent, inject this brief into its prompt** (DEC-004 rule 5).
6. If anything is ambiguous, add to `/guidance/questions.yaml` and stop.

When done:
1. Fill in spec's `## Build Completion` (including reflection).
2. Append a build cost session entry to `cost.sessions`.
3. `just advance-cycle SPEC-NNN verify`.
4. Create `DEC-*` files for non-trivial build decisions. When a
   decision is tied to specific code, fill in its `affected_scope`
   with the path globs it governs (e.g. `src/lib/log.ts`,
   `src/api/**`). This is required for file-bound decisions — it's
   what lets `just decisions-audit --changed` surface the decision
   when those paths change later. Leave `affected_scope: []` only for
   decisions not tied to particular files (e.g. a process choice).
5. Open PR.

### During **verify**

Start **another new session**. Do not reuse build session.

Check: acceptance criteria met? tests pass? no decision drift? no
constraint violations? non-trivial choices have DEC-*? build reflection
answered honestly? `cost.sessions` has entries for prior cycles
(flag if missing, don't block)?

For the "decision drift" check, run `just decisions-audit --changed` —
it flags which `DEC-*` records govern the files this spec touched, so you
can confirm the build stayed consistent with them. `just decisions-audit`
(no flag) lints the records themselves. See
`/guidance/recommended-tools.md` for optional, heavier verify tooling
(e.g. LineSpec for protocol-level integration tests).

For any acceptance criterion that claims **runtime behavior** (a component
registers, a hook fires, a binary resolves on PATH, a server answers, a config
takes effect), confirm the *behavioral* surface was actually exercised — not just
the shape validated (§12 behavioral pre-flight). This is the class that escapes.

Append a verify cost session entry to `cost.sessions`.

Output: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED.

### During **ship**

Append `## Reflection` to spec. Three answers. Append a ship cost
session entry, then compute `cost.totals`. Then
`just archive-spec SPEC-NNN`. If stage backlog is complete, run the
Stage Ship prompt.

**Cutting a release?** A release is its own spec — scaffold it with
`just new-release-spec "<version>" STAGE-NNN` (or `just new-spec … --release`).
It carries a generic runtime **pre-flight checklist** (tag integrity, artifact
trust on a clean host, channel trust, data isolation, runtime smoke, rollback —
DEC-006); fill in the tool-specific command for each before you publish. Every
defect that escaped design→build→verify across the dogfood projects was
operational/runtime, so don't skip it. For the version to cut, run
`just next-version` — it follows this app's `spec.version.scheme` (default
`calver`; DEC-007). That app version lives in git tags; the top-level `VERSION`
file is template provenance, not the app's version (see `docs/versioning.md`).

If Reflection Q2 surfaces a template/constraint/decision change you're
**not** making this session, don't let it evaporate — record it in
`guidance/signals.yaml` (a recurring coding pattern → `type: lesson`
with its N-count; framework/tooling friction → `type: process-debt`).
The close-disposition ritual (Prompts 1d/1e) then forces a decision on
it. See `docs/signals.md`; browse with `just dash signals`.

Log the win — **on by default** (DEC-010). Call the configured tool directly
(default `brag`): `brag add -t "<what shipped>" -k shipped -i "<IMPACT>"` (CLI),
or the `brag_add` tool over `brag mcp serve` (MCP). Seed it from the spec's
`value_link` + `cost.totals`, and frame the **impact** (the outcome / who's
better off), not the output. See `guidance/recommended-tools.md`; opt out via
`spec.accomplishments.enabled: false`.

---

## 16. Session Hygiene (claude-only specific)

Because one agent plays multiple roles, context contamination is a real
risk. Five habits keep it at bay:

1. **New session per cycle where possible.** Especially design → build
   and build → verify.
2. **Never reference "as I said earlier"** in later cycles. The spec
   is the source of truth.
3. **Weekly review is non-optional.** Without a second agent pushing
   back, drift compounds silently. Run `just review`.
4. **Honest confidence values on decisions.** See Section 17.
5. **One git worktree per concurrent session.** If more than one session
   works on this repo at once, each MUST run in its own `git worktree`,
   not the shared checkout — two agents writing one working tree corrupt
   each other (a parallel build can clobber an uncommitted edit, or a
   commit can land on the wrong branch). `git worktree add <path> <branch>`,
   work there, commit + push, then `git worktree remove`. Always check
   `git branch --show-current` before any commit.

### Delegated execution (sub-agents) — DEC-004

When you delegate a build or verify cycle to a fresh sub-agent (e.g. via the
Agent tool), five rules keep the delegation honest:

1. **Reconcile over self-report — never advance a cycle on a sub-agent's word
   alone.** After it returns, verify the *claimed* result against actual **git +
   disk** state before you advance `task.cycle`:
   - `git log <base>..HEAD` — are the commits actually there?
   - the spec's `## Failing Tests` files exist on disk, and the gate actually ran?

   Trust git/disk over **any** agent self-report or timeline marker — both lie:
   a truncated report can claim "done" with the commit, tests, or gate still
   missing. **If the sub-agent dies mid-cycle** (overloads/kills happen): reconcile
   the partial output, finish the *mechanical remainder* in the main loop (don't
   re-run the whole cycle), and attribute cost to the sub-agent's metered portion
   (its `subagent_tokens`), recording the main-loop finish as a separate
   null-with-note cost session.
2. **One sub-agent at a time; no interleaved tree ops.** Launch exactly one
   build/verify sub-agent, then do **no** git/tree operations — no `new-spec`,
   `checkout`, or commits, and don't design the next spec — until it reports
   complete and its branch is merged. Sub-agents share this working tree and are
   auto-backgrounded; interleaving corrupts a branch. The structural fix is
   per-agent `git worktree` isolation (habit 5 above).
3. **Set the sub-agent's model explicitly** from `.repo-context.yaml`
   `spec.agent.tier_map` (design/build/verify) — don't rely on a default (a
   silent Opus default is a ~6× cost surprise). `new-spec`/`new-patch` already
   stamp `agents.*` from it (DEC-005).
4. **Sanction a trivial dev-dep + its DEC in one build pass.** A non-interactive
   sub-agent can't stop-and-ask, so the `no-new-top-level-deps-without-decision`
   constraint carves out an exception: a build cycle MAY add a clearly-trivial
   **DEV-only** dependency (types packages, test utilities — **never** a runtime
   dep) and author its DEC in the same pass. This keeps the constraint's teeth
   for real (runtime) choices while sparing you the `@types/node`-stub workaround.
5. **Inject the toolchain brief into the sub-agent's prompt.** A cold sub-agent
   re-imports generic tool-priors and wastes loops rediscovering this repo's
   specifics. Give it `/guidance/toolchain-brief.md` (test framework + assertion
   lib, lint/format quirks, runtime globals, installed dev utilities, gotchas) so
   it doesn't. The template ships the slot; the instance fills the truth — keep
   the brief current or a sub-agent will trust a stale fact.

---

## 17. Confidence Discipline

Decisions have an `insight.confidence` field (0.0–1.0). Honest values drive:

- **Design:** decisions at confidence < 0.7 also create a question in
  `/guidance/questions.yaml`.
- **Verify:** specs referencing decisions at confidence < 0.6 get a
  yellow flag.
- **Weekly review:** all decisions < 0.8 are listed with strength/weakness trend.

Most decisions should land between 0.7 and 0.95. 1.0 only for truly locked choices.
