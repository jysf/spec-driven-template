# AGENTS.md — Claude-Only Variant

Instructions for Claude working across all phases of this repository. Read this file first, every session.

> This variant assumes Claude plays every role: architect, implementer, reviewer. The context normally in a handoff document lives inside each spec's `## Implementation Context` section.

> This file contains conventions only. For rules/constraints, see `/guidance/constraints.yaml`. For architectural rationale, see `/decisions/`. For waves of work against this app, see `/projects/`.

## 1. Repo Overview

- **Repo (the app):** [REPLACE: My App]
- **Purpose:** [REPLACE: one sentence]
- **Primary stakeholders:** [REPLACE]
- **Active project:** [REPLACE: PROJ-001 — MVP]

See `.repo-context.yaml` for structured metadata.

---

## 2. Work Hierarchy

```
REPO (the app — persists across all projects)
 └─ PROJECT (a wave of work: "MVP", "improvements", "v2 redesign")
     └─ STAGE (a coherent chunk within a project)
         └─ SPEC (an individual task)
```

- The **repo** is the app. `AGENTS.md`, `/docs/`, `/guidance/`,
  `/decisions/` live at repo level because they accumulate across all
  projects.
- A **project** (`/projects/PROJ-*/`) is a bounded wave of work.
- A **stage** is an epic-sized chunk within a project (2–5 per project).
- A **spec** is a single implementable task. Belongs to one stage in
  one project.

In this variant, Claude plays architect and implementer in **separate
sessions**. The spec file itself carries all the context — see its
`## Implementation Context` section.

**Decisions persist at repo level.** A decision made during PROJ-001
binds PROJ-002 as well.

**Specs do not cross project boundaries.**

---

## 3. Business Value

Value structure exists at project and stage levels; specs link lightly.

**Project `value:` block** states the thesis — a testable claim about
what this wave of work delivers. Beneficiaries, success signals, and
risks to the thesis make it falsifiable, not marketing copy.

**Stage `value_contribution:` block** states what this coherent chunk
of work advances, what capabilities it delivers, and what it
explicitly doesn't try to do. Helps avoid stages that seem valuable
but don't contribute to the project thesis.

**Spec `value_link:`** is a one-sentence reference back to the
stage's value. Infrastructure specs may have
`value_link: "infrastructure enabling X"`. Optional but encouraged —
it surfaces specs that don't trace back to the thesis.

Reports (`just report-daily`, `just report-weekly`) aggregate these
signals: which stages advanced the thesis, which specs most directly
delivered it, and where value traceability broke down.

---

## 4. Cost Tracking Discipline

Every cycle on a spec appends a session entry to the spec's
`cost.sessions` list. Agents self-report so reports can aggregate AI
spend over time.

- **Claude Code:** run `/cost` at the end of your session.
- **API calls:** use the `usage` object in the API response.
- **Claude.ai web:** estimate based on session length. Set
  `interface: claude-ai` so reports can distinguish estimates.
- **Third-party agents** (Ollama, Kilo, Factory, etc.): use whatever
  cost mechanism the agent provides. If none, enter null numeric
  values with a note.

Verify cycle flags specs missing cost entries for prior cycles (does
not block the PR — visibility only). Ship cycle computes `cost.totals`
from the session entries.

Reports aggregate cost by cycle, by interface, by spec, and by stage.

## 8. Cycle Model

Every spec moves through five cycles. **Cycles are tags, not gates**.

| Cycle | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **frame** | Go/no-go on the spec |
| **design** | Write the spec + failing tests + implementation context |
| **build** | Make failing tests pass |
| **verify** | Review + validation in one pass |
| **ship** | Merge, deploy, reflect, archive |

Valid transitions:
```
frame → design → build → verify → ship
                   ↑       │
                   └───────┘ (verify sends back on punch list)
```

**In this variant**, use **separate Claude sessions** for each cycle.
A fresh session prevents design-phase context from contaminating build
decisions, and a fresh verify session catches drift a continuation
session wouldn't.

Project and stage lifecycles are lighter:
- **Project status:** `proposed | active | shipped | cancelled`
- **Stage status:** `proposed | active | shipped | cancelled | on_hold`

---

## 9. Instruction Timeline

Every spec has a timeline file at
`projects/*/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md` listing cycle
instructions in order with status markers.

Status markers:

- `[ ]` not started — no one has picked this up yet
- `[~]` in progress — an executor is currently running this
- `[x]` complete — cycle finished; see the prompt file for what was run
- `[?]` blocked — needs a human decision or external unblock before
  proceeding. Include a one-line reason after the marker.

Cycle prompts live at `projects/*/specs/prompts/SPEC-NNN-<cycle>.md`.
The architect writes them; executors read and run them.

**Discipline for executors:**

- When you start a cycle, mark it `[~]`.
- When you finish, mark it `[x]` with a one-line result (PR number,
  cost, completion date).
- If you hit a real blocker — constraint ambiguous, dependency
  missing, verify surfaced something needing architect judgment —
  mark `[?]` with a one-line reason. Do NOT use `[?]` as a "I don't
  know what to do" dumping ground. Blocked means the next move
  requires someone else; everything else is in-progress or a
  question to resolve in the current session.

This is a convention, not a mechanism. No tooling enforces it; the
discipline lives in the prompt set. Skip it and nothing breaks, but
you lose the history artifact and the next executor has to hunt for
the right prompt.

## 10. Cross-Reference Rules

Every spec has these relationships, encoded in front-matter:
- `project.id` → the project it belongs to
- `project.stage` → the stage within that project
- `references.decisions` → DEC-* it was designed against
- `references.constraints` → constraints that apply

DECs are stable; specs come and go. DECs don't reciprocally list specs.

- **Imports:** [REPLACE]
- **Error handling:** [REPLACE]

## 12. Testing Conventions

- Every new function gets at least one test.
- Test file naming: [REPLACE]
- Coverage expectations: [REPLACE]
- **TDD:** Tests live in the spec's `## Failing Tests` section, written
  during **design**, made to pass during **build**.

---

## 13. Git and PR Conventions

- **Branch:** `feat/spec-NNN-<slug>`, etc.
- **One spec per branch, one PR per branch.**

## 15. Cycle-Specific Rules

### During **build**

Start a **new Claude session**. Do not continue from the design session.

Before writing code:
1. Read the spec's `## Implementation Context` section.
2. Read every `DEC-*` it references.
3. Read the parent `STAGE-*.md` and project `brief.md`.
4. Read `/guidance/constraints.yaml`.
5. If anything is ambiguous, add to `/guidance/questions.yaml` and stop.

When done:
1. Fill in spec's `## Build Completion` (including reflection).
2. Append a build cost session entry to `cost.sessions`.
3. `just advance-cycle SPEC-NNN verify`.
4. Create `DEC-*` files for non-trivial build decisions.
5. Open PR.

### During **verify**

Start **another new Claude session**. Do not reuse build session.

Check: acceptance criteria met? tests pass? no decision drift? no
constraint violations? non-trivial choices have DEC-*? build reflection
answered honestly? `cost.sessions` has entries for prior cycles
(flag if missing, don't block)?

Append a verify cost session entry to `cost.sessions`.

Output: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED.

### During **ship**

Append `## Reflection` to spec. Three answers. Append a ship cost
session entry, then compute `cost.totals`. Then
`just archive-spec SPEC-NNN`. If stage backlog is complete, run the
Stage Ship prompt.

## 16. Session Hygiene (claude-only specific)

Because one agent plays multiple roles, context contamination is a real
risk. Four habits keep it at bay:

1. **New session per cycle where possible.** Especially design → build
   and build → verify.
2. **Never reference "as I said earlier"** in later cycles. The spec
   is the source of truth.
3. **Weekly review is non-optional.** Without a second agent pushing
   back, drift compounds silently. Run `just weekly-review`.
4. **Honest confidence values on decisions.** See Section 17.

---

## 17. Confidence Discipline

Decisions have an `insight.confidence` field (0.0–1.0). Honest values drive:

- **Design:** decisions at confidence < 0.7 also create a question in
  `/guidance/questions.yaml`.
- **Verify:** specs referencing decisions at confidence < 0.6 get a
  yellow flag.
- **Weekly review:** all decisions < 0.8 are listed with strength/weakness trend.

Most decisions should land between 0.7 and 0.95. 1.0 only for truly locked choices.
