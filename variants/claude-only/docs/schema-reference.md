# Schema reference — the front-matter contract

The YAML front-matter on each artifact **is the public API** of this repo: it's
what the `just` commands, the reports, `--json` output, and any downstream
consumer (an MCP server, a ContextCore exporter, a UI) read. This document is
the canonical shape. Field names follow ContextCore / OTel semantic conventions
where they overlap (see the alignment section at the end).

> `DEC-NNN` references point to the **spec-driven template's own design log**
> (its `docs/decisions/`), not files in this repo.

**What enforces what:**
- `just validate` — every spec has the required **structural** fields below with
  valid values. Gate: exits non-zero on any violation (CI-suitable).
- `just cost-audit` — every *shipped* spec has real build/verify cost.
- `just decisions-audit` — `DEC-*` records are structurally sound + scope-linted.

Legend: ✅ required · ◦ optional · `enum{…}` allowed values · `set{…}` suggested/open values (validate warns-only on anything outside, never fails).

## `.repo-context.yaml` — the repo (a ContextCore `RepoContext`)

```
apiVersion: contextcore.io/v2 ✅      kind: RepoContext ✅
metadata.repo: { id ✅, name ◦, purpose ◦, url ◦ }
metadata.business: { criticality ◦ enum{critical,high,medium,low}, owner ◦, contacts[] ◦ }
spec.stack: { language, runtime, framework, database, hosting }  ◦
spec.agent: { default_model ◦, tier_map{design,build,verify} ◦ }              # DEC-005
spec.cost:  { metering_source ◦ enum{subagent_tokens,api_usage,manual,none}, rate_per_mtok ◦, currency ◦ }  # DEC-005
```

`spec.agent` / `spec.cost` (DEC-005) parameterize the model + cost seams so the
template runs on a non-Claude agent by config, not a fork. Defaults reproduce the
Claude-Code workflow. `just cost-audit` honors `spec.cost.metering_source`:
`none` disables the gate (no token source on the platform); anything else keeps
it enforced. See `docs/porting.md`.

## `projects/PROJ-*/brief.md` — a project

```
project: { id ✅, status ✅ enum{proposed,active,on_hold,shipped,cancelled}, activity ◦ set{requirements,design,build,test,blocked}, priority ✅ enum{critical,high,medium,low}, target_ship ◦ }
repo.id ✅
created_at ✅   shipped_at ◦
value: { thesis ◦, beneficiaries[] ◦, success_signals[] ◦, risks_to_thesis[] ◦ }
roadmap[] ◦: { item ✅, kind ◦ set{framed,planned,pillar,goal}, horizon ◦ set{now,next,later}, resume_when ◦, target ◦ }
```

### The declared `roadmap:` block (DEC-011)

**A project's roadmap has two halves, and only one of them is a file.**
`just roadmap` **derives** the first half — `framed` (a `STAGE-*.md` exists) and
`planned` (a `## Stage Plan` checkbox with no file yet). That covers work that
is shaped or at least named. It cannot express intent that isn't a stage yet.

`roadmap:` is the **declared** half: themes and outcomes too coarse or too early
to frame. `just roadmap` merges both and `--json` emits them together, so a
portfolio tracker consumes **one typed surface** instead of re-parsing briefs.

- **`kind`** — `pillar` (an unframed theme coarser than a stage) or `goal` (an
  outcome rather than work; the seam where a future value metric attaches).
  `framed`/`planned` are *inferred from files*, never authored.
- **`horizon`** — `now | next | later`. Buckets are primary on purpose: a dated
  roadmap you can't hit is worse than a bucketed one you can.
- **`resume_when`** — an optional trigger ("after the daily report stabilizes").
  Honest when a date can't be committed.
- **`target`** — an optional `YYYY-MM-DD`. Discouraged as the *only* signal.

**Reconciliation.** An `item:` naming a real stage (`item: STAGE-004`) is *not*
listed twice. The derived record wins on status and dates — it is read from the
file, which is ground truth — and the declared `horizon`/`resume_when` ride
along on that row. Only items with no stage behind them appear in the
`declared` bucket.

Both vocabularies are **suggested sets, not enums**: `validate` warns on an
unrecognized `kind`/`horizon` and never fails. The block is optional everywhere,
and its absence is the normal case — most projects never need it, because the
Stage Plan already says what is coming.

**`status` vs `activity` — two axes, don't conflate them.** `status` is the
**coarse, machine-keyed** lifecycle state that tooling branches on (keep it to the
enum above). `activity` is an **optional, human-facing** refinement of the work
happening *within* an `active` project — it says *what kind of work is going on
right now* without abusing `status` or making a project look stalled. Its
vocabulary is a **suggested open set** (`requirements | design | build | test |
blocked`), extend it as needed (e.g. `spike`); `validate` warns on an
unrecognized value but never fails. Example — a live project gathering
requirements before any spec is framed:

```
project:
  id: PROJ-006
  status: active
  activity: requirements
```

Downstream consumers may treat some activities as deliberately quiet phases
(e.g. suppress "cut a release" / "close this project" nudges during
`requirements`).

## `projects/PROJ-*/stages/STAGE-*.md` — a stage (epic)

```
stage: { id ✅, status ✅ enum{proposed,active,shipped,cancelled,on_hold}, priority ✅ enum{critical,high,medium,low}, target_complete ◦ }
project.id ✅   repo.id ✅
created_at ✅   shipped_at ◦
value_contribution: { advances ◦, delivers[] ◦, explicitly_does_not[] ◦ }
```

## `projects/PROJ-*/specs/SPEC-*.md` — a spec (the unit `just validate` gates)

```
task: { id ✅, type ✅ enum{epic,story,task,bug,chore,release}, cycle ✅ enum{frame,design,build,verify,ship},
        blocked ◦, priority ◦, complexity ✅ enum{XS,S,M,L,XL,XXL}, complexity_actual ◦,
        verify_verdict ◦ enum{approved,punch-list,rejected} }
project: { id ✅, stage ✅ }            repo.id ✅
agents: { architect ◦, implementer ◦, created_at ◦ }
references: { decisions[] ◦, constraints[] ◦, related_specs[] ◦ }
depends_on[] ◦   # blocking: specs that must SHIP first (feeds `just ready`)
claimed_by ◦     # fan-out lease: who holds this spec now; null = free
value_link ◦
cost: …                                 ◦ structurally; ✅ on shipped specs via cost-audit
```

**`verify_verdict` — what verify actually decided.** The three values are the
three verdicts Prompt 4 already returns (`✅ APPROVED` / `⚠ PUNCH LIST` /
`❌ REJECTED`), so nothing new is asked of the verifier — the answer just stops
living only in prose. `just advance-cycle` stamps it whenever a spec **leaves**
verify, in either direction:

| Move | Recorded |
|---|---|
| `verify → ship` | `approved` |
| `verify → build` (or `design`/`frame`) | `punch-list` |
| either, with `--verdict rejected` | `rejected` |

Stamping only on the way to `ship` would record approvals and silently drop
every rejection — which is the number actually worth having. The destination
can't distinguish `punch-list` from `rejected` (both go back to build), so that
one call is manual; the command always prints what it recorded so an inferred
value can be corrected.

Advisory in `validate`, never a gate: a spec that never reached verify has no
verdict, and back-filling one onto a spec that shipped before the field existed
would be fiction. Read it with `just dash defects`, which pairs it with the
defect-catch distribution — where a defect was *caught* versus whether verify
ever *pushed back*.

The **required structural set** `just validate` enforces: `task.id`,
`task.type`, `task.cycle` (valid enum), `task.complexity` (valid enum),
`project.id`, `project.stage`, `repo.id`. Files under `specs/prompts/` and
`*-timeline.md` are not specs and are skipped.

`task.complexity` is the **expected** size, set at design; `task.complexity_actual`
is the size stamped at **ship** (optional, same enum, advisory-only if
unrecognized). Paired with the optional `cost.tokens_estimate` prediction, they
feed `just calibration` — expected vs actual, warn-only. `S|M|L` predate the
t-shirt widening (v0.6.26) and remain valid.

A **release spec** (`task.type: release`, DEC-006) is a spec subtype: it reuses
this exact schema (so `validate` / `cost-audit` / `status` treat it as a normal
spec — `status` tags it `[release]` and exposes `task.type` in `--json`) and
adds a generic runtime **pre-flight checklist** in the body. Scaffold it with
`just new-release-spec "vX.Y.Z" STAGE-NNN` (or `just new-spec … --release`).

## `projects/PROJ-*/patches/PATCH-*.md` — a patch (the patch lane, DEC-003)

A **patch** is a bounded fix to already-shipped behavior; it uses the same
`task.*` schema as a spec so `just validate` / `cost-audit` / `status` treat it
as first-class, with two differences: `task.cycle` is the collapsed
`patch|verify|ship`, and there is **no `project.stage`** (a patch attaches to the
project, not a stage).

```
task: { id ✅ (PATCH-NNN), type ✅ =patch, cycle ✅ enum{patch,verify,ship},
        blocked ◦, priority ◦, complexity ✅ enum{S,M,L} }
project.id ✅   repo.id ✅            agents: { implementer ◦, verifier ◦, created_at ◦ }
references.decisions[] ◦
cost: …                                 ◦ structurally; ✅ on shipped patches (patch+verify) via cost-audit
```

`just validate` requires `task.id/type/complexity`, `task.cycle` ∈
{patch,verify,ship}, `project.id`, `repo.id` (not `project.stage`). `cost-audit`
requires a real `tokens_total` on the **patch** and **verify** cycles of a
shipped patch. See the patch-lane section in `AGENTS.md` and DEC-003.

### The `cost` block (template extension — see DEC-002)

```
cost:
  sessions:                              # one entry appended per cycle
    - cycle: <frame|design|build|verify|ship>
      agent: <model id>
      interface: <claude-code|claude-ai|api|ollama|other>
      tokens_total: <int>                # ONE combined count (real on build/verify)
      estimated_usd: <float>             # order-of-magnitude estimate
      duration_minutes: <number>
      recorded_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
      notes: <string>
  totals: { tokens_total: <int>, estimated_usd: <float>, session_count: <int> }
```

`cost-audit` requires a positive `tokens_total` on the `build` and `verify`
cycles of shipped specs; `design`/`ship` (main-loop) may be null. No
ContextCore/OTel cost convention exists — this is a documented template
extension (DEC-002).

## `decisions/DEC-*.md` — a decision (ContextCore `insight.*`)

```
insight: { id ✅, type ✅ enum{decision,analysis,recommendation,observation}, confidence ✅ 0.0–1.0,
           audience[] ◦ enum{executive,developer,agent,operator} }
agent: { id ◦, session_id ◦ }
project.id ◦   repo.id ✅
created_at ✅   supersedes ◦   superseded_by ◦
status ◦ set{proposed,accepted,rejected,deprecated,superseded}
deciders[] ◦                             # WHO made the call (not which agent was present)
affected_scope[] ◦                       # path globs; powers decisions-audit --changed
tags[] ◦
```

**`type` is the kind of insight, not the subject.** `architecture`, `security`,
`process` and friends are **tags**, not types — put them in `tags[]`. (Learned
the hard way: the template's own log used `type: architecture` on 11 of 13
decisions while every one of them *also* carried `architecture` in `tags`.)

**`status` is optional, and absent is the normal state.** Omit it and tooling
derives `active` / `superseded` from `superseded_by` exactly as it always has, so
an existing decision log reads unchanged. Declare it when the record has to say
something that link cannot:

- `proposed` — written down but not binding yet. Without this, a draft decision
  is indistinguishable from a live one.
- `rejected` — considered and turned down. **This is the one that earns the
  field**: with nowhere to record a rejection, the same option gets re-litigated
  every few months, and the reasoning survives only in prose.
- `deprecated` — still true, on the way out, not yet replaced by a specific DEC.

Vocabulary is an **open set** (the `project.activity` precedent): `decisions-audit`
warns on an unrecognized value but never fails. The one hard rule is agreement —
`status: superseded` with a null `superseded_by`, or a non-`superseded` status
with `superseded_by` set, is a **structural error**, because the two fields then
disagree about the same fact.

**`deciders[]` records who decided, and `agent.id` does not.** `agent.id` says
which agent was in the room; only `deciders` distinguishes *"the human made this
call"* from *"the agent made this call."* For the calls `AGENTS.md` says must not
be delegated, this is the cheapest mechanical trace that they weren't.

## `guidance/constraints.yaml` — repo rules (ContextCore `guidance.*`, type=constraint)

```
constraints[]: { id ✅, rule ✅, severity ✅ enum{blocking,warning,advisory},
                 paths[] ✅, added_by ✅, added_at ✅, rationale ✅ }
```

`severity` is about **enforcement**, not planning priority. Canonical mapping
from a critical/high/medium/low rating: `critical`/`high` → **blocking**,
`medium` → **warning**, `low` → **advisory** (also in the `constraints.yaml` header).

`guidance/questions.yaml` is the same model with `guidance.type = question`.

## `guidance/signals.yaml` — the typed feedback ledger (template extension)

```
signals[]: { id ✅, type ✅ enum{lesson,process-debt,product,risk,golden-path}, summary ✅,
             evidence ✅, bar ◦ (lessons + golden-paths), status ✅ enum{open,watch,accepted,
             rejected,codified,done,dropped}, disposition_at ✅ enum{stage-close,
             project-close}, first_flagged ✅, last_touched ✅, raised_by ✅, notes ◦ }
```

One ledger for every feedback type, so nothing rots un-decided (`lesson` is
dispositioned at a stage close and keeps the N=3/N=2 codification bar;
`process-debt`/`product`/`risk`/`golden-path` at a project close). The forcing
function is the close-disposition ritual in `FIRST_SESSION_PROMPTS.md`
(Prompts 1d/1e), not a CI gate. Browse with `just dash signals`; the open count
surfaces in `just dash`'s flags. No ContextCore/OTel namespace spans these
types, so `--json` emits a template-native `signal.*` payload (like `cost.*`, a
documented extension). Full authoring guide + migration note: `docs/signals.md`.

**`golden-path` is the only type that records something that WORKED.** Every
other type is a problem — a lesson, a debt, a risk, a usage gap. That left
*"this approach worked so well another project should copy it wholesale"* with
nowhere to live, so it was lost at every close. It matters because the template
has **no instance-to-instance transfer mechanism at all**: knowledge flows *up*
through harvests and *down* into new scaffolds, never sideways from one repo to
the next.

**The bar is harder here, not softer.** A wrong paved road is worse than no
road, because people follow it. Capture candidates freely; promote almost none —
N=3 or it stays a preference.

## `projects/PROJ-*/handoffs/HANDOFF-*.md` — *(claude-plus-agents only)* (ContextCore `handoff.*`)

```
handoff: { id ✅, from_agent ✅, to_agent ✅, from_role ◦, to_role ◦, created_at ✅,
           status ✅ enum{pending,accepted,completed,rejected} }
task.spec_id ✅   project: { id ✅, stage ✅ }   repo.id ✅
```

## ContextCore / OTel alignment

The field names above mirror ContextCore's semantic conventions (verified
against its `docs/reference/` + `semconv/registry/`); see
DEC-001 §5 for the full crosswalk.
In short: `task.*`, `project.*`, `business.*`, `insight.*`, `guidance.*`,
`agent.*`, `handoff.*` align; `task.cycle` is the template's SDLC specialization
of `task.status` (no 1:1); and `cost.*` is a template extension that ContextCore
and OTel GenAI don't yet have (DEC-002 proposes it upstream). `--json` output
(DEC-001 §2) carries these attribute names so the repo can feed a ContextCore /
OTel pipeline without scraping.

> Versioning: a `schema_version` per artifact is planned so changes are
> detectable; until then, schema changes are tracked via decisions + a migration
> note (precedent: `MIGRATION_TO_REPORTS_AND_COSTS.md`).

## Structured output (`--json`) and exit codes

The read/dashboard commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output — the
contract a consumer (an MCP server, a ContextCore exporter, a dashboard) reads
instead of scraping text. Supported: `dash` (and every lens — `now` / `next` /
`future` / `ledger`), `status`, `specs-by-stage`, `roadmap`, `backlog`. Default
human output is unchanged.

Stable envelope:

```
{ "schema_version": 1, "command": "<name>", "generated_at": "<UTC ISO-8601>",
  "data": { … } }
```

The `data` payload uses the ContextCore/OTel attribute names above (`task.id`,
`task.cycle`, `project.stage`, `cost.tokens_total`, `cost.estimated_usd`, …).
`just dash --json` stitches the `status` and `roadmap` reports plus a cost
rollup. The report generators (`report-daily` / `report-weekly`) emit markdown,
not `--json` — their files are already a portable artifact.

> If your `just` version intercepts the flag, pass it after `--`:
> `just status -- --json`.

Exit-code contract (DEC-001 §2):

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | success (read commands always; gates when clean) |
| `1` | gate failure — a real violation (`cost-audit`, `validate`, `decisions-audit`) |
| `2` | usage error (unknown flag/argument) |
