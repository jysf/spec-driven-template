# scripts/cost-audit.sh — the mechanical backstop for the Cost Tracking
# Discipline (AGENTS.md §4). Fails if any SHIPPED spec is missing real
# build/verify cost data (a positive `tokens_total` on those cycles).
#
# Why this exists: documentation alone tells agents to record cost, and
# documentation alone is skippable — cost tracking silently goes empty
# (all-null numerics) the moment a prompt says "leave it null". A check
# makes it stick. Same pattern as wiring a license policy into CI: a
# discipline made mechanical with a `just` check + a CI job.
#
# Scope: only build/verify cycles are required (those run as metered
# subagents whose token count is in the Agent result). design/ship are
# orchestrator main-loop cycles and may legitimately be null.
#
# Grandfathered pre-process specs are skipped — see
# COST_AUDIT_GRANDFATHERED in scripts/_lib.sh (empty in a fresh template
# instance; populate it only if you adopt the gate after shipping specs
# without it).
