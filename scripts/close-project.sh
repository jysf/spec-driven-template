# scripts/close-project.sh — the mechanical half of the project-close ritual.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Close was never "thin" — Prompt 1e is seven-plus steps and its
# signal-disposition walk is one of the more rigorous rituals here. The gap was
# an ASYMMETRY: close was the only major ritual with no command behind it.
#
#   spec ship   → archive-spec    stamps shipped_at, computes cost.totals, audits cost
#   patch ship  → archive-patch
#   spike land  → archive-spike   REFUSES without spike.outcome
#   stage close → (nothing)
#   proj close  → (nothing)   ← this file
#
# So the spike lane refuses to land without an outcome, while a project close
# would happily flip a status with specs in flight, an empty reflection, and
# signals silently carried. This closes the asymmetry; it does NOT rewrite the
# ritual, which stays in FIRST_SESSION_PROMPTS.md Prompt 1e.
#
# THREE HARD REFUSALS, and the principle behind them is the spike lane's:
# refuse when the missing thing is the exact failure the ritual exists to
# prevent; warn otherwise.
#
#   1. Specs still in flight — but ONLY when you claim `shipped`. In-flight
#      specs contradict "shipped" and corrupt every rollup computed over them.
#      Under `abandoned`/`parked` they are expected, so the refusal lifts. That
#      makes closed_reason load-bearing rather than decorative.
#   2. An empty Project-Level Reflection — the direct analogue of spike.outcome.
#      The reflection is the artifact close exists to produce.
#   3. Open signals owned by project-close. The v0.5.18 ritual says these get
#      dispositioned at close and nothing enforced it. `defer-with-trigger` is a
#      legal disposition, so the refusal always has an honest escape hatch.
#
# Everything else warns: a missing closed_reason, an empty value.thesis. Refusing
# on a null thesis would punish exploratory projects, which the value model
# explicitly allows.
#
# Usage:
#   just close-project PROJ-NNN [--dry-run] [--json]
#
# Exit status: 0 closed (or dry-run clean) · 1 refused · 2 usage error.
